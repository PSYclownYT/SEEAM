# Seeam Docs
Hello! and thank you for choosing Seeam! The worst way to distribute your files!

## Creating A New App
#### Requirements
you will need either pipreqs, or a clean python installation.
#### Setup
To setup your environment, you will need to set up a file structure like so:

```
myapp
‚îÇ   description.txt
‚îÇ   main.py    
‚îÇ   thumbnail.png
‚îÇ   requirements.txt
‚îÇ   (optional) extras.py 
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ‚îÄassets
```
The assets path will be where your program's assets will be located.
(make sure the description doesn't have too many lines or else it will be too long to display the play button)
**Im pretty sure this is case-sensitive**

>main.py is the main script that will be executed when your app is launched. 
>[For Premade Apps](#premade-apps)
>extras.py is an **OPTIONAL** extra button on your apps launcher page, that will run extras.py. this is recommended to open a settings page, or run checks.
Thumbnail.png is the thumbnail of your app
description.txt is the description of your app

### Generating Installable Thingy
##### With pipreqs:
```powershell
  pipreqs "/path/to/your/app"
```
##### With clean install or venv
```powershell
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt
#this puts EVERYTHING pip has installed into requirements.txt
```
Finally, select all of the files, and compress them into a .zip file. upload this to somewhere online where you can get a direct download link, and there you go!

## Already Made apps
You may want to redistribute an app as a seeam package to provide ease of installation to customers. this is pretty easy to do.
### Windows packages:
use this code in `main.py`
```python
import os
os.startfile("assets\example.exe")
```
### Web apps
webapps are a bit more customizable. here is the code snippet (`main.py`)
```python
from  tkinter  import  *
import  webview
import  webview.window
# define an instance of tkinter
tk  =  Tk()
# size of the window where we show our website
tk.geometry("1920x1080")
tk.attributes('-fullscreen',True)
# Open website
webview.create_window('Google', 'https://google.com', fullscreen=True)
webview.start()
```
